# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

Refactored HTML and CSS code to ensure in meet accessiblity standards. I did this by ensuring 
there are semantic HTML elements and they follow a logical structure. All images now also have alt text to abide
by  accessibility standards, and the website now has a concise title. The acceptance criteria that was met is stated below.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
